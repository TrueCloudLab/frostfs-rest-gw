# frostfs-rest-gw

FrostFS REST Gateway bridges FrostFS internal protocol and REST API server.

## Installation

### Building

Before building make sure you have the following tools:

* go
* make
* git
* curl
* docker

First clone this repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/TrueCloudLab/frostfs-rest-gw
```

Then run make to build `bin/frostfs-rest-gw` binary:

```shell
$ make
```

Or you can build it using docker:

```shell
$ make docker/all
```

#### Generate go-swagger boilerplate code

If you change the [spec file](./spec/rest.yaml) you have to re-generate go-swagger server code.

You have several approaches:

1. Run make. It automatically downloads `swagger` and generates boilerplate.

```shell
$ make
```

2. Generate code separately:

```shell
$ make generate-server
```

Or using docker:

```shell
$ make docker/generate-server
```

#### Other targets

Notable make targets:

```
dep             Check and ensure dependencies
image           Build clean docker image
image-dirty     Build dirty docker image with host-built binaries
formats         Run all code formatters
lint            Run linters
version         Show current version
generate-server Generate boilerplate by spec
```

### Docker

Or you can also use a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/truecloudlab/frostfs-rest-gw) provided for released
(and occasionally unreleased) versions of gateway (`:latest` points to the latest stable release).

## Execution

REST gateway itself is not a FrostFS node, so to access FrostFS it uses node's gRPC interface and you need to provide some
node that it will connect to. This can be done either via `-p` parameter or via `REST_GW_POOL_PEERS_<N>_ADDRESS` and
`REST_GW_POOL_PEERS_<N>_WEIGHT` environment variables (the gate supports multiple FrostFS nodes with weighted load balancing).

If you're launching REST gateway in bundle with [frostfs-dev-env](https://github.com/TrueCloudLab/frostfs-dev-env), you can get
an IP address of the node in output of `make hosts` command
(with s0*.neofs.devenv name).

These two commands are functionally equivalent, they run the gate with one backend node (and otherwise default
settings):

```shell
$ frostfs-rest-gw -p 192.168.130.72:8080
$ REST_GW_POOL_PEERS_0_ADDRESS=192.168.130.72:8080 frostfs-rest-gw
```

It's also possible to specify uri scheme (grpc or grpcs) when using `-p`:

```shell
$ frostfs-rest-gw -p grpc://192.168.130.72:8080
$ REST_GW_POOL_PEERS_0_ADDRESS=grpcs://192.168.130.72:8080 frostfs-rest-gw
```

## Configuration

In general, everything available as CLI parameter can also be specified via environment variables, so they're not
specifically mentioned in most cases (see `--help` also). If you prefer a config file you can use it in yaml format.
See [config](./config/config.yaml) and [defaults](./docs/gate-configuration.md) for example.

```shell
$ frostfs-rest-gw --config config.yaml
```

## Docs

You can see additional docs and swagger specification using the following url
(suppose you ran rest-gw on `localhost:8090`):

* http://localhost:8090/docs - rest-gw documentation
* http://localhost:8090/v1/docs - swagger specification
